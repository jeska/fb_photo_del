Python script to check when a deleted photo on Facebook has actually, well, been deleted. You need to manually enter the picture URL and date you removed it (though I might add functionality to simply put this in a file) and then place it in a cron job. I have mine run at midnight every day.

In this version, it emails you every week to remind you that, yes, your photo is still somewhere in Facebook's Haystack. When it finally deletes, it notifies you.
